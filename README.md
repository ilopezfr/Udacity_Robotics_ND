# Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Program Overview

This program covers:
- the software fundamentals to work on robotics using C++, ROS, and Gazebo
- how to build autonomous robotics projects in a Gazebo simulation environment
- probabilistic robotics, including Localization, Mapping, SLAM, Navigation, and Path Planning.


## Project Overview

### P01 - Build My World
-  Have fun as you learn how to use Gazebo to visualize and prototype a robotics environment.
### P02 - Go Chase It!
- Demonstrate your new proficiency with ROS, C++, and Gazebo by building a robot that can chase colored balls.
### P03 - Where am I?
- Use the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization algorithm in ROS to estimate your robotâ€™s position.
### P04 - Map My World
- Deploy RTAB-Map on your simulated robot to localize your robot and create 2D and 3D maps of your environment.
### P05 - Capstone: Home Service Robot
- Program a home service robot that will autonomously map an environment and navigate to pick up and deliver objects.
### P06 - Optional: KUKA Robotic Arm Path Planning
- Navigate a KUKA robot through a 2D maze.
